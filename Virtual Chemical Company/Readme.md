Virtual Chemical Company

Course Project | Mar’24 – Apr’24
Instructor: Prof. Raghavendra Ragipani

Overview

This project evaluates the feasibility of manufacturing high-value chemicals within a virtual chemical company. The work includes identification of commercially valuable chemicals, process development and scale-up, market analysis, environmental assessment, and cost estimation.
The main chemical studied was Aspartame, with supporting analysis for Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) and Citric Acid.

Objectives

Identify high-value industrial chemicals

Assess market viability and raw material availability

Develop scalable production processes (up to 1000 kg/day)

Perform capital investment and profit estimation

Evaluate regulatory, safety, and environmental compliance

Chemicals Studied

Aspartame (Primary focus)

Acetaminophen (Paracetamol)

Citric Acid

Aspartame Plant Design (Primary Case Study)

Key highlights:

Enzymatic and chemical synthesis routes were analyzed

Industrial scale production designed for approx. 1000 kg/day

Material and energy balances performed

Major equipment identified (glass-lined + carbon steel reactors)

Major capital investment requirements estimated

Global and domestic supply chain evaluated

Environmental and safety constraints reviewed

Key findings:

Feasible raw materials include L-Aspartic Acid, Methanol, L-Phenylalanine, and AET catalyst

Major process stages: esterification, condensation, crystallization, neutralization

Process yields calculated at each stage

Industrial production was found to be commercially feasible
